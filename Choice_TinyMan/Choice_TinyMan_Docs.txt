# Algorand
##################
Algorand is a proof-of-stake blockchain, which improves security and power efficiency of blockchain networks. 
In fact, Algorand is the most technically advanced and sophisticated blockchain technology. 
The Algorand blockchain utilizes advanced post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms and zeroknowledge proofs (ZKPs). 
The Algorand network also includes a democratic consensus mechanism for voting, using a new Byzantine Agreement protocol.

# Choice Coin
##################
A voting token for autonomous organizations, Choice Coin is built on the Algorand Blockchain as an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA).
Choice Coin is a digital asset, which is used to solve the decentralized voting problem. 
The decentralized voting problem refers to a lack of a systemic governance mechansim for decentralized organizations. 
Choice Coin provides a mechanism by which decentralized organizations can vote securely using post-quantum cryptography. 

# TinyMan
##################
Tinyman is a liquidity pool software which supports Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) liquidity pools.
The software is innovative insofar as it allows users to perform swaps and yield farming with minimal fees.
As such, TinyMan provides access to small market places, leveling the playing field with institutionized finance.
TinyMan is a great decentralized finance (DeFi) technology on the Algorand network.

# Liquidity
##################
Liquidity pools are accounts holding two different ASAs contributed by poolers.
In return for providing assets, poolers receive a share of transaction fees.
Liquidity must be added and withdrawn in ASA pairs.
In exchange for providing liquidity, poolers receive pool tokens.
Pool tokens can be withdrawn at anytime for the proportional representation of the pool.

# Swaps
##################
A swap is an ASA transfer to or from a liqudity pool.
Swaps can be made using the TinyMan web applicaition or using the TinyMan Python SDK.
Swaps initiate an ASA transfer from the swapper's wallet and the liquidity pool.
